Maximize utilization: Right-size workloads and implement efficient design to verify high utilization and maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware. Two hosts running at 30% utilization are less efficient than one host running at 60% due to baseline power consumption per host. At the same time, reduce or minimize idle resources, processing, and storage to reduce the total energy required to power your workload.
