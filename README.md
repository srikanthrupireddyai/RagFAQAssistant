# AWS Well-Architected Framework FAQ Assistant

## Legal Disclaimer

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

This is an independent, educational project that provides a tool for processing and retrieving information from AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation. Users should always refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) for authoritative and up-to-date information.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation is copyrighted by Amazon Web Services, Inc. This project does not redistribute any AWS documentation. Users are responsible for downloading the official documentation themselves and for complying with AWS's terms of use.

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that allows users to query AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation using natural language. This implementation uses TF-IDF embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search without requiring external API keys.

## Features

- üìö Query AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation with natural language
- üîç TF-IDF vectorization for document embedding without external API dependencies
- üöÄ FAISS vector store for efficient similarity search
- üíª Works completely locally with no API quota limitations
- üß© Modular design that can be extended with other embedding models or LLMs

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Sufficient memory to load document embeddings and the FAISS index

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srikanthrupireddyai/aws-well-architected-faq-assistant.git
   cd aws-well-architected-faq-assistant
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key (optional - needed only if you want to use LLM-based answers):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Download AWS Documentation**:
   - Visit the [AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
   - Download the official documentation in your preferred format
   - Create a directory called `raw_docs/` in the project root
   - Place the downloaded documentation files in this directory
   - **Note**: This repository does NOT include any AWS documentation files

3. Run the embedding creation script to process your documents and create the vector store:
   ```bash
   python create_embeddings.py
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

To start an interactive session with the FAQ assistant:

```bash
python query_assistant.py
```

This will launch the interactive console where you can ask questions about the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

### Single Query Mode

To ask a single question programmatically:

```bash
python query_assistant.py "What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?"
```

### Integration Mode

You can also import the assistant in your Python code:

```python
from query_assistant import answer_question

result = answer_question("What are the pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework?")
print(result["answer"])
print("Sources:", result["sources"])
```

## How It Works

1. **Document Processing**: The system reads AWS Well-Architected Framework documents and splits them into manageable chunks.

2. **Embedding Creation**: Instead of using external embedding APIs, the system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to create document embeddings locally. This approach:
   - Works entirely offline
   - Avoids API rate limits and costs
   - Eliminates dependency on external services

3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index, which enables efficient similarity search.

4. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question:
   - The query is converted to a TF-IDF vector
   - FAISS finds the most similar document chunks
   - The system returns the most relevant passages along with their source documents

5. **LLM Integration** (Optional): If an OpenAI API key is provided, the system can use GPT models to generate concise answers based on the retrieved passages.

## Extending the System

### Using Different Embedding Models

The current implementation uses TF-IDF for simplicity and avoiding dependencies, but you can modify the `create_embeddings.py` script to use other embedding models:

- HuggingFace sentence-transformers (requires additional dependencies)
- OpenAI embeddings (requires API key)
- Other local embedding models

### Adding LLM-based Responses

While the current implementation is retrieval-only, you can enhance it with LLM-powered answers by modifying the `query_assistant.py` file to use models like:

- OpenAI's GPT models
- Local LLMs (like Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- Other API-based language models
